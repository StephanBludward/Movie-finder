# Who Created the Code?

The Classic Movie Recommender project was primarily developed by our team, with assistance from the following:
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: Some code snippets and explanations were provided by ChatGPT.
- **Existing Libraries**: I utilized various Python libraries, such as Flask, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, to handle web functionality, data processing, and recommendations.

### Contributions from Others
- Open-source for CSS and Google Fonts for typography.
